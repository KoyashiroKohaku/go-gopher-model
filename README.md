# Go Gopher model
> A 3D model of the Go Gopher mascot. We ❤ Go.

## Why?

The conversation went something like this:

> Walter (Developer): Go uses a Gopher as a mascot. We just want to highlight the language in a project.
>
> David (Animator): Here you go.
>
> Walter (Developer): Whoa that's trick. Why the sweet 3D animation?
>
> David (Animator): Because I can.

This results in this render out of Maya:

Which lead to a render we could use in a slidedeck:

Which then results in animated jibbily jelly go gophers uniting on Vine:

Which then finally results in this CC0 repo of all the Go Gopher goodness. Enjoy!

Print all the things!
